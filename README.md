  <dd>Twitter Profanity Search is a react app that scrapes a user's tweets and looks for possible instances of profanity. It makes calls to the Node.js backend server, (in the API folder) which fetches the user's tweets, looks for profanity, then returns a list of words with tweets that feature them.</dd>
